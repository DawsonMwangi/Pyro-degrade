We built and tested our first proof of concept model in 2018 - it had the capacity to process up to 6kgs of plastic waste per batch. In June 2018 we exhibited it at the African Youth Innovation Summit in Kigali, Rwanda. 

In 2019 we were selected to join the Royal Academy of Engineering Fellowship. We then made progress and built a domestic model that had the capacity to process up to 30kgs of plastic per day. We took our time in designing and learning how to build our own equipment based on our specific needs. We build our machinery from the ground up and it is designed it to be self sufficient. 

In 2020 we completed building our commercial processing equipment. We have identified over 100 farmers in Kenya who we intend on engaging in our pilot.

As of 2021 we are now ready to go fully commercial. We are done with building our processing equipment, this has the capacity of processing up to 300kgs of plastic per day running at 20% performance. However by building the plant we intend on this will be able to go to as high as 1 tonne per day. Our business model involves a process that integrates all players in the value chain. Right from the plastic waste supplier to the pyrolysis oil buyer. We also realized that for some large scale farmers it will make more sense if we build them their own plants due to their high consumption rate.
