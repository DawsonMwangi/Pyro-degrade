teaser: At Pyro-degrade Energy we've developed a technology to produce pyro-diesel from plastic waste. Weâ€™ve designed our processor to be self-sufficient - able to run off-grid powered by the fuel it produces. Pyro-diesel is an environmentally friendly diesel substitute - it is almost sulphur free and has a low carbon footprint. Our efficient production process means that we are able to supply pyro-diesel at a lower cost than ordinary diesel.
