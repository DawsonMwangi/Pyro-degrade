Globally plastic waste is a very big problem, mainly due to the fact that we produce more plastic waste than we consume; recycling or disposing. We strongly believe that we can change this narrative by changing peopleâ€™s perception about plastic waste by making them see is as a resource that can actually be used in income generation. This is where Pyro-degrade Energy comes in.

At Pyro-degrade Energy we buy waste plastic from plastic pickers; grade it, clean it, shred it and bale it. We then process it to fuel. Our fuel is used as a diesel alternative for stationery diesel powered engines. Pyro-diesel is free from Sulphur and has less carbon emission and is more affordable as compared to ordinary diesel.
